## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-13
## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-22

### Added
- Optional import of FortiGate config files to build an in-app object catalog (addresses, groups, services, VIPs, vip groups) used at export-time for exact name mapping.
- FortiGate CLI export (policies only) including security profiles and logging settings.
- Unique policy-name enforcement (max 35 chars) with automatic suffixing and header summary.
- Guided Suggestions flow with one-by-one proposals and inline naming; resume to next group after any decision.
- Pre-export validation blocking unknown address/service names not present in loaded configs.
- Interface exclude list for CLI export (default: `_default`, `VLAN1`), configurable via `PM_INTERFACE_EXCLUDE`.

### Changed
- Address/service tokenization is now catalog-aware and greedy, preserving multi-word object names exactly as in configs.
- `_default.VLANX` expansion refined and SSL VPN interface mapping (`sslvpn_tun_intf` â†’ `ssl.root`).
- Suggestions/merge unions honor dominance: `all`/`any` for addresses, `ALL` for services.

### Fixed
- Numerous GUI crashes (teaching tips timing, About page objectName, enum usages, missing methods).
- Deduplication no longer happens on import; user reviews and confirms in Dedupe page.
- Merges now correctly reduce Final Review count and persist after refresh.
